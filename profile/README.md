🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Thank you for using Arion. (And if you aren't, SWITCH NOW.) Arion was inspired by the Greek horse Arion, known to be the fastest horse alive. That's exactly what this language is. FAST. Like C.

And guess what? It's as easy as python, too.
